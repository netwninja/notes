* mongodb does not support "." (dot) inside key string

* pymongo, something trigger "TypeError: document must be an instance of dict, bson.son.SON, bson.raw_bson.RawBSONDocument, or a type that inherits from collections.MutableMapping"

* pymongo output has objectID, need to use custom jsonencoder
